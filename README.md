# ComputerVision

I will update this repo as I study on computer vision, face recognition in details. I'm generally interested in computer vision, how algorithms capture the facial characteritistics. The concept is quite similar to what I've written in <a href=https://github.com/kckenneth/MNIST_digits>MNIST digit classification</a>. In digits classification, the approach is also the same, instead of human faces, it's digits and the algorithm identifies which digits belong to which categories.
